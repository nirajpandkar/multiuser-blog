* Select Python as the language
* Select appropriate location to serve your app from.


### Download and install SDK
* Create an environment variable for the correct distribution:
```
export CLOUD_SDK_REPO="cloud-sdk-$(lsb_release -c -s)"
```
* Add the Cloud SDK distribution URI as a package source:
```
echo "deb http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $CLOUD_SDK_REPO main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
```
* Import the Google Cloud public key:

curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
* Update and install the Cloud SDK:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
```
* Install the python additional component:
```
sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk-app-engine-python
```
* Run the following to select the current project:
```
gcloud init
```

## Local Development

* Clone this repository and `cd` into it - 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nirajpandkar/multiuser-blog.git
$ cd multiuser-blog
```

* Use `dev_appserver.py` to locally run an instance of the app. (Note the `.` after `dev_appserver.py` which indicates current directory.)
```
$ dev_appserver.py .
```
* You can access your application at `http://localhost:8080`
* You can also access your datastore here - `http://localhost:8000`
## Deploy application

* Follow the [App Engine Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/quickstart) to get a sample app up and running.

* Change directory into application and use `gcloud` command to deploy your app:
```
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
```

## Future Scope

* Make the blog front page as minimal as possible by showing only a certain number of lines of each blog.
* Fill the right side bar with popular and recent blog titles.
